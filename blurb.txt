Figure \ref{fig:flowchart} shows an overview of the entire Omnibot MMS. The majority of the computational work is done on the remote desktop. Running ROS, the remote desktop uses five ROS nodes to perform its given tasks. The features of the command strategy are programmed within the Fixtures node, with the four other nodes on the remote desktop facilitating communication with the joystick, motion capture device, Omnibot, and the user (for activating/deactivating the virtual fixtures and datalogging feature). The cameras for the motion capture system connect to the Optitrack computer, which uses Optitrack's Tracking Tools software to track objects within the work cell and broadcast their positions using NATNet protocols. The Mocap node on the remote desktop reads the motion capture broadcast data and publishes the Omnibot MMS pose and target data through ROS to be read by the Fixtures node. The Joystick node uses the Falcon Application Programming Interface (API) to communicate through USB to the Falcon joystick. The Joystick node receives force commands from Fixtures and sends the joystick position back. The Datalogger node provides a command line interface to the system, allowing the operator to enable/disable the virtual fixtures as well as record the experimental data. The Talker node uses TCP IP socket communication to send the movement commands it receives through ROS from the Fixtures node. The Talker node also receives the joint configuration of the manipulator so it can calculate the manipulator's local pose using forward kinematics. The manipulator's pose in local coordinates are received by the Fixtures node through ROS, and the manipulator and base's position in global coordinates are sent to the Fixtures node via the Optitrack computer and Mocap node.\\
